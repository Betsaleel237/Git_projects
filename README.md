# Git_projects

Here are ten advanced Git projects, each designed to tackle a complex Git scenario and utilize advanced Git techniques:

---

### 1. **Distributed Team Collaboration with Feature Flags**

   - **Scenario**: A team works on a large project where features are continuously tested and released. They need to manage features using feature flags without creating too many branches.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a `main` branch for production and a `development` branch for new features.
     2. Use feature branches off `development` for each feature.
     3. Apply feature flags in the codebase and keep them toggled off until testing is complete.
     4. Merge tested features into `main` only when the feature flag is toggled on.
     5. Remove old feature flags periodically for a cleaner codebase.

### 2. **Implementing Git Submodules in a Large Project**

   - **Scenario**: The project requires multiple repositories, but dependencies between them must be tracked.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a main project repository and submodule repositories for each module.
     2. Add each submodule with `git submodule add <url>`.
     3. Commit and push submodule changes in the main repository.
     4. Update submodules in the main repo when dependencies change using `git submodule update`.
     5. Clone the main repo with submodules using `git clone --recursive <repo>`.

### 3. **Automating Releases with Git Hooks and CI/CD**

   - **Scenario**: Automated deployment for every code push is required. Git hooks trigger CI/CD pipelines and manage releases.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up a pre-commit hook to run tests locally.
     2. Create a post-commit hook to push commits to a CI/CD pipeline.
     3. Set up the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application for every successful test.
     4. Use tagging to manage versioning with `git tag -a v1.0 -m "version 1.0"`.
     5. Push tags to trigger release jobs in the CI/CD system.

### 4. **Implementing Git Bisect for Bug Tracking in Large Codebase**

   - **Scenario**: A bug is present in a specific commit, and the developer needs to find the exact commit that introduced the bug.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Identify a known "good" commit and a "bad" commit.
     2. Use `git bisect start` to begin the bisect process.
     3. Mark the known good commit (`git bisect good`) and the bad commit (`git bisect bad`).
     4. Bisect will automatically check commits in between; mark each tested commit as good or bad.
     5. After identifying the commit, end the process with `git bisect reset`.

### 5. **Managing Multiple Remote Repositories for a Forked Workflow**

   - **Scenario**: A developer works on a forked repository and needs to sync changes from the main project regularly.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Clone your forked repository and add the main repository as an additional remote using `git remote add upstream <main-repo-url>`.
     2. Fetch the latest changes from the main repository with `git fetch upstream`.
     3. Rebase your fork's changes on top of the upstream's latest commits using `git rebase upstream/main`.
     4. Resolve any conflicts and push changes to your forked repo with `git push origin`.
     5. Submit pull requests to contribute back to the main project.

---

### 6. **Handling Git Reflog for Recovery of Lost Commits**

   - **Scenario**: Accidental reset or rebase leads to losing important commits, and they need to be recovered.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Check recent commit history with `git reflog`.
     2. Identify the SHA hash of the lost commit.
     3. Use `git checkout <SHA>` to review the commit’s content.
     4. Create a new branch if needed from this point with `git checkout -b <recovered-branch>`.
     5. Merge the recovered branch back into your working branch.

---

### 7. **Maintaining Stable Release Branches with Hotfixes**

   - **Scenario**: A team needs to maintain multiple release versions and apply hotfixes only to specific versions.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create stable branches for each major release, e.g., `release-v1.0`, `release-v2.0`.
     2. For each hotfix, create a branch off the specific release branch.
     3. Apply the hotfix and test thoroughly.
     4. Merge the hotfix into the release branch with `git merge`.
     5. Optionally, cherry-pick hotfixes into the `main` branch if necessary.

### 8. **Creating a Monorepo with Git Filter-Branch**

   - **Scenario**: Separate repositories for different modules of a project need to be merged into a single monorepo.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Clone the main monorepo or create a new repository.
     2. For each separate repository, use `git filter-branch` to rewrite the history and place it in a dedicated folder within the monorepo.
     3. Add each repository as a remote and fetch its content.
     4. Use `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories` to bring them together.
     5. Consolidate each repo’s history under the monorepo structure.

---

### 9. **Using Git Worktrees for Multi-Branch Development**

   - **Scenario**: A developer needs to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching between them in the same working directory.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a worktree for each branch using `git worktree add ../branch-folder <branch-name>`.
     2. Navigate to each worktree directory to work on that branch independently.
     3. Commit and push changes from each worktree as needed.
     4. Remove a worktree after completion with `git worktree remove <branch-folder>`.
     5. Use worktrees to test interactions between branches without merging.

### 10. **Rewriting History with Interactive Rebase for Clean Commits**

   - **Scenario**: A messy commit history with multiple unnecessary commits needs cleanup before merging into the main branch.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use `git rebase -i <base-commit>` to start an interactive rebase.
     2. Mark commits you want to squash, reword, or edit.
     3. For each commit marked, apply desired actions, like `pick`, `squash`, or `edit`.
     4. Save and close to rewrite the history with the cleaned-up commits.
     5. Force push changes to the branch with `git push --force`.
